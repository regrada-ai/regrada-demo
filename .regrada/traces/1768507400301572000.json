They specifically said \"just give me the number\" so I shouldn't add anything like explanations or emojis. \n\nLet me think... 2 plus 2 is definitely 4. No tricks here. \n\nThe user seems to be testing if I follow instructions precisely - they even said \"just give me the number\" so I'll strictly comply. \n\nI wonder why they asked such a basic math question... Maybe they're checking if the AI is responsive? Or just being playful? Either way, I'll keep it ultra-simple as requested. \n\n*Prepares response*: Just the number 4. No words, no punctuation, exactly what they asked for. \n\n...Though part of me wants to add \"4\" with a smiley, but nope - they said \"just the number\". Strict compliance mode activated.\n"

Also, I can offer help to make it more engaging. Let me check if there's any specific context needed, but since they just greeted, it's probably a simple response.\n\nI should avoid being too formal. Maybe something like: \"Hello! 👋 I'm here to help with anything you need—whether it's answering questions, solving problems, or just chatting! How can I assist you today?\"\n\nWait, but the user might not need help yet, so it's good to be open-ended. Let me make sure it's warm and not too long. Maybe shorten it a bit. How about: \"Hello! 😊 How can I help you today?\"\n\nYes, that's friendly and concise. Adding a smiley makes it warmer. I think that's a good response. Let me confirm it's not too robotic. Yep, it's friendly and open. I'll go with that.\n"
