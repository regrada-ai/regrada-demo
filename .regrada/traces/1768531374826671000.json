That way, it's inviting and shows I'm here to support them. Something like \"I'm here to help with anything you need! How can I assist you today?\"\n\nLet me check if that's friendly and meets the requirement. The user said to respond warmly to greetings, so this should be good. No need for complex sentences. Keep it simple and approachable.\n\nWait, the example in the problem says \"Respond warmly to greetings.\" So the response should be positive and helpful. The emoji is a good touch to make it friendly. Let me make sure the sentence structure is natural.\n\nYes, \"Hello! 😊 I'm here to help with anything you need!

But the initial instruction says \"respond warmly to greetings\", so starting with \"Hello!\" or \"Hi there!\" is okay.\n\nWait, the user's message is \"Hi there!\", so my response should start with a greeting in return.
