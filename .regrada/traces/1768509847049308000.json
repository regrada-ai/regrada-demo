I recall that in math, 2+2=4 is a fundamental equation. \n\nThe user might be testing if I follow instructions precisely, or maybe they're just being playful. But since they emphasized \"just give me the number,\" I'll stick to the minimum response. \n\nI wonder if they're a kid learning math, or someone checking if the AI is helpful. Either way, keeping it super simple matches their request. \n\n*Double-checking*: Yep, 2+2=4. No tricks here. \n\nAlright, response will be exactly \"4\" with no additional text. Strictly following their \"just give me the number\" instruction. \n\n...Though part of me wants to add \"😊\" to be friendly, but they said \"just the number,\" so I'll resist.
