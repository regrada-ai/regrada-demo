Maybe they're testing if I follow instructions? Or just being playful? Either way, keeping it super simple is key here. \n\nAlso, the user seems to want a warm but minimal response—no jokes, no extra text. Just the number 4. \n\n*Double-checks*: Yep, 2+2=4. No tricks here. \n\nAlright, I'll reply with just \"4\" to match their request perfectly. No extra words, no smiley faces—strictly what they asked for. \n\n...Though part of me wants to add \"😊\" to be friendly, but they said \"just the number.\" Better stick to the brief. \n\nFinal decision: Pure number response.
