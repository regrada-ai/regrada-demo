The answer is definitely 4. \n\nI notice they specifically said \"just give me the number\" – that means they don't want explanations, examples, or anything else. They're probably in a hurry or just testing if I can follow simple instructions. \n\nSince they're being direct, I'll keep it super simple. No need for \"the answer is...\" or \"so...\" just the number 4. \n\nAlso, they seem friendly since they used \"just give me\" – not aggressive or frustrated. I'll match their tone with a warm but minimal response. \n\n*Double-checking*: Yep, 2+2=4 is elementary math. No tricks here. \n\nFinal response: Just \"4\" to respect their request perfectly.\n"
