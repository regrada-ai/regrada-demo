Like asking how they're doing or what they need help with today.\n\nWait, the user might just be saying hello, so I don't want to overdo it. Keep it simple but warm. Maybe something like \"Hello! 👋 How can I help you today?\" That's friendly and opens the door for them to ask anything.\n\nI should check if the response is in the right tone. The user said \"friendly assistant\" so using emojis like 😊 or 👋 might be good to add warmth. Also, making sure the language is simple and not too formal.\n\nLet me see if there's anything else. Maybe add a bit more warmth, like \"I'm here to help with anything!\" But the user might not need that much. Keep it concise.\n\nHmm, the example response I thought of: \"Hello! 😊 How can I help you today?\" That sounds good. It's friendly, uses an emoji, and asks how they can help. That should work.\n\nWait, the user might be testing if I'm friendly. So making sure it's a warm response. Maybe adding a smiley emoji to show enthusiasm.\n\nI think that's a solid response.

The parameters should be a JSON object with \"city\" as the key and \"Tokyo\" as the value.\n\nI'll make sure the function name is correctly spelled as get_weather and the arguments are in the right format. No other parameters are needed since the function only requires the city.\n\nDouble-checking the tool definition: the get_weather function has a city parameter of type string.
